<h1>Cisco</h1>
<p>Cisco Secure Email is a spam filter, block list, and firewall solution for businesses. Mail is routed through mailservers owned by Cisco (iphmx.com) before it's passed along to the recipient domain's mailservers for final delivery. The recipient is able to manage a lot of delivery settings such a allow lists,so it helps to ask the recipient to run the described debugging tests in the user guide to identify and resolve delivery issues, as there is no way to contact the vendor directly.</p>
