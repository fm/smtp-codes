<h1>Outlook.com</h1>
<p>Outlook is an email provider for predominantly Outlook, Hotmail, and Live freemail addresses, as part of Microsoft. For legitimate messages going to the spam filter or getting blocked, you'll likely need to file a false-positive report with Outlook support. For globally-blocked IPs, the adminstrator of the IP will need to request delisting directly.</p>

Use the link below to check the status of your IP. You must cooperate with Spamhaus to resolve the listing. Remember that even once the listing is removed, it may take receivers up to 24 hours to refresh their cache and to see delivery resume.</p><ul>
