<h1>Exchange Online Protection</h1>
<p>Exchange Online Protection (EOP) is the spam filter for Microsoft 365, the business productivity suite from Microsoft. It provides businesses with spam filtering, block lists, and firewall protection. If a message is going to spam or getting blocked, there are typically instructions for the email admin to fix the specific error in Exchange documentation.</p>
