<h1>SMTP Error Code 550</h1>
<p>The transaction failed permanently. The server will not try to send the message again. This is used as a general error code, so there are many reasons why you could be seeing it.<br><br>It’s common for email service providers to add a status code (5.1.1) after the SMTP reply code (550) for additional categorization of the issue.</p>
