<h1>Barracuda</h1>
<p>Barracuda is a spam filter, block list, and firewall for businesses. Mail is routed through mailservers owned by Barracuda before it's passed along to the recipient domain's mailservers for final delivery. The recipient is able to manage a lot of delivery settings such as allow lists, but sender reputation issues that affect all Barracuda customers globally may require contacting Barracuda support directly to resolve.</p>
