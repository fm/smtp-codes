<h1>Proofpoint</h1>
<p>Proofpoint is a spam filter for businesses. Mail is routed through mailservers owned by Proofpoint (*.pphosted.com or *.ppe-hosted.com) before it's passed along to the recipient domain's mailservers for final delivery. The recipient is able to manage a lot of delivery settings such a allow lists and spam filtering policy levels. For globally-blocked IPs, the adminstrator of the IP will need to request delisting directly.</p>
