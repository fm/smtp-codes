<h1>Google</h1>
<p>Google offers both a freemail option (Gmail) and a range of online services for business domains (Google Workspace). They boast total automation and machine learning as their spam filtering and anti-abuse systems. There are few methods for contacting a human to review delivery issues, since options for human intervention in these kinds of processes are also limited. Instead all senders should be monitoring their domains at Google Postmaster Tools daily for insight into reputation and performance.</p>
